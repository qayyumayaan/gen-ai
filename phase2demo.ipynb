    "In this Jupyter notebook, I successfully demonstrate the process of building a semantic search system using two distinct in-memory vector databases: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) and OpenSearch. Initially, I take a sample PDF file and utilize the LangChain PDF loader to chunk the content, converting the text into embeddings using OpenAI's technology. These embeddings are then loaded into a FAISS in-memory store for semantic search. Through the Python Notebook, I show how to query the FAISS vector store, effectively performing similarity searches based on the embedded text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, I transition to using OpenSearch, a scalable search engine, replacing FAISS while maintaining the same methodology. I load the same PDF into an OpenSearch index equipped with a KNN (k-nearest neighbour) search algorithm, using the same chunking algorithm provided by the LangChain PDF loader. Finally, I demonstrate querying the OpenSearch KNN-enabled index, thereby showcasing the ability to conduct semantic searches in a Python Notebook environment. This exercise not only highlights the versatility of semantic search technologies but also underscores my practical application of these advanced tools in processing and extracting meaningful information from text data."
